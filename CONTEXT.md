# ArgentBank project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

You have just started working at Remede Agency, an agency specialising in web application development. The team is mainly composed of back-end developers and has just started recruiting other front-end specialists.

### My role

For this one I only had a code base with some static HTML and CSS. I nedded to build the app on React, to add connection to a profile page where the user could edit his last and first name and to create potential future endpoints for transactions with the Swagger editor.
